## AeroGear OAuth2 Adapter sample test thing

you need to run this on a server so the quickest way is,

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

then go to http://localhost:8000

Currently this will test against the Google OAuth2 api's.  i've created a sample app and turned on the calendar and google+ api's

The index page will not show much, so open up dev tools to see the console output.
